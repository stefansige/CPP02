Exercise 00: Create a class representing fixed-point numbers in Orthodox Canonical Form. It includes private members for the fixed-point value and the number of fractional bits, and public members for constructors, destructor, copy operations, and functions to get/set the raw value.

Exercise 01: Enhance the fixed-point number class by adding constructors that accept integers or floating-point numbers, functions to convert fixed-point numbers to float or int, and an overloaded insertion operator (<<) to output the fixed-point number.

Exercise 02: Further improve the fixed-point number class by overloading comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement operators, as well as implementing static member functions to find the minimum and maximum values between two fixed-point numbers.

Exercise 03: Implement a function to determine if a point is inside a triangle using fixed-point numbers. This exercise also involves creating a Point class in Orthodox Canonical Form with attributes for x and y coordinates, and appropriate constructors, destructor, copy operations.
